Temperature conversion program in C++ [5 pts]
Requirements:

Redo the programming assignment from Homework 1 in C++ on UHUNIX. Replace all C input/output statements with C++ statements (cin, cout, cin.getline) to get the same formatted output as Homework 1.

    Do not use the header file stdio.h, use iostream
    Must contain a function called convertFtoC with the following prototype:
        void convertFtoC( int, float &);

Your submission must include the following:

    Source Code
    Proof of compilation
    Output with ONE test case.

Here is the description of Homework 1 for your reference:

    Contains a user-interface function which requests the user to enter the maximum temperature as an int.
    If the maximum temperature entered is not an integer, the program must display an error message and prompt the user to re-enter the temperature.
    If the maximum temperature entered is less than or equal to 0, the program must display an error message and prompt the user to re-enter the temperature.
    Contains a function to round up the maximum temperature to the next multiple of 5 (For example 90 will remain 90, but 91 will become 95)
    Contains a print function which uses a while loop to generate a table starting from 0 F to the maximum temperature in increments of 5 F
    Contains a function called convertFtoC with the following prototype:
        float convertFtoC(int);   // Uses the formula: C = (F - 32) * (5 / 9)
    The table output must be formatted.
    A sample output of your program is shown below. Columns for Celsius must have two decimal places and must be right aligned.

<Print a brief message to the user describing your program>

Please enter a maximum temperature in Fahrenheit (F): 93
Temperature in F 	Temperature in C
0 	-17.77
5 	...
10 	...
... 	...
 	 
... up to the maximum temp (in this case 95)
