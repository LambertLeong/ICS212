All requirements were met and the program performs as it is supposed to.  All llist functions do what they are designed for.   However, the add, delete, and modify method do not work well once the list has been reversed.  Further improvements will most likely include functions that will work properly in relation to a reversed list.  Additional functions were added in the “myinputfunctions.cpp” to help gather user input.  One feature that I would like to improve in the future involves the handling of integer and character combinations for integer input; essentially integer input validation.  It is currently documented that in the case that an integer value is followed by any character and integer combination, the program will take the first integer and ignores the characters and integers following it.  User interface can always be improved for future enhancements.  Adding the option to read and write to user chosen files is another improvement that can be made
