Exercise 1: TEST PLAN [5 pts]

Write a test plan consisting of a series of tests and desired outcomes to completely test Project 1 based on the specifications provided in Homework 3. You will need around 30 to 40 tests to go through all the requirements.
Example:
Test 1: 	Start the program by typing the program name with no arguments.

    Revised algorithm for the addrecord and deleterecord.
    Below or next to each line in the algorithm, write the corresponding C code.
    Traces that verify the algorithm for the following test cases:
        Adding a duplicate record to the start of the list
        Beginning with a list that consists entirely of two duplicate records, delete all duplicates so you end with an empty list.
