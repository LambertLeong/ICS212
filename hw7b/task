Homework 7b: Recursion

The road stripe painters have formed a union. Each painter will only paint a section of 2 miles of stripes on the road and charge $200 for the service. If the road is longer than 2 miles, the painter will divide the road into three equal parts, and subcontract each of those parts to three other painters, charging $100 to hire the three painters. Each of the hired painters will do the same thing as the painter who hired them. If their section is 2 miles or less, they will paint it and charge $200, otherwise they will divide their section into three parts, charge $100 and hire three more painters, and so on. Write a recursive function which is used to solve the above problem. The prototype for the function must be:

int costofpainting(double length);

Write a driver to test the function with the appropriate test cases. The driver obtains the input and prints the output.
