Homework 4:

This homework must be submitted by the due date. Late points cannot be used for this homework.

Assume the following variables are already defined, initialized and available for you to use:

    start: pointer to the start of the list (or NULL)
    uaccountno: The user's account number
    uname: The address of the array containing the user's name
    uaddr: The address of the array containing the user's address
    uyob: The user's year of birth

Assume the following struct definition:

    struct record
    {
        int               accountno;
        char              name[25];
        char              address[80];
        int               yearofbirth;
        struct record*    next;
    };

Requirements:
Write the pseudocode for the following two functions:

    deleteRecord: Must delete ALL records (including duplicates) based on the account number
    addRecord: Must add a record to the singly linked list so the list is in ascending order based on accountno

    There must be no use of any C code in the algorithm
    You may only use the allowed vocabulary from the list below with variations to accommodate different memory locations

Vocabulary list:

    Define a <pointer to record> called <temp>
    Allocate space for a new record on the heap and store its address in the <next field of the record whose address is in temp>
    Delete the record whose address is in <temp>
    <while or if> (the <next field of the record whose address is in start> is not <NULL>)
    Copy from the <name field of the record whose address is in temp> into the <name field of the record whose address is in temp2>

Your submission should include the following:

    pseudocode for the addRecord and deleteRecord functions from Homework 3 using a single linked list for the database.
    Traces that verify the algorithm for the following test cases:
        Add record to empty list
        Add record to the end of the list with 2 records
        Delete account number that matches first record from list with 3 records
        Delete account number that matches second record from list with 3 records
