Programming class hierarchy

Create a simple program which uses the following class hierarchy:

animal
  protected:   char sound[10];              // contains "moo", "quack"
               unsigned char data;          // 0 - cannot fly, 1 - can fly
                                            // number of legs - 3 bits

  public:      virtual void displaydata(); // prints the value of sound and fly

cow: derived from animal
  public:       void displaydata(); // prints the value of sound, number of legs and fly

bird: derived from animal
  public:       void displaydata(); // prints the value of sound and fly
Requirements:

    Each class must have its own .cpp and .h file, including constructors and destructors.
    Use bit-wise operators to both set and retrieve fly and number of legs
    Write a main function which creates instances of the animal, cow and bird class.
    Use the vector and map classes in the main function.
        Need to show that you are able to create them, fill them with values, and retrieve the stored values.
        If you want, you can fill them up with pointers to animals and use them to test polymorphism. 
    Initialize the instances and call the animaldisplaydata function to test polymorphism on the displaydata function of the bird and cow class.

    void animaldisplaydata(animal * a)
    {
      // Your code goes here...
    }

Your submission must include the following:

    Source Code
    Proof of compilation
    Output showing that your program works as expected
