Homework 7A

Review this PDF description of the TCP header format. Eveything you need to know about TCP to complete this assignment is in this document. If you decide to Google information on TCP, do not apply what you read online to this exercise.

Download these three TCP header binary files.

    test1.bin                      (download test1.bin.txt)
    test2.bin                      (download test2.bin.txt)
    test3.bin                      (download test3.bin.txt)

Write a program that will do the following:

    Read the binary file into an unsigned char array and print the header.
    Create a response header and write it to a new file.
    Read the response binary file and print the header

Note: By binary file we mean the .bin files, NOT the .bin.txt files (i.e. your program should read / write .bin files, not .bin.txt files). Those are provided for your own convenience so that you can see the contents of the .bin files in hex if you cannot find a hex editor (we still strongly recommend that you do try to read the .bin files with a hex editor if possible). You will receive 0 points if your program reads / writes .bin.txt files. Note that the "|" in the .bin.txt files are only there to separate each set of 4 bytes (i.e. each line in the TCP header diagram). They do not exist in the actual binary file.
Requirements:

    The response file will switch the source and destination ports
    The sequence number must be incremented by 1 for the response
    The acknowledgment number of the response must be sequence number of the request
    If the SYN flag is set in the request, both the SYN and ACK flags must be set in the response
    If something is wrong with a part of the header, fix it when creating the response.
    You must have the following functions:
    int printheader();
    int readfile(char []);    // Tip: Use the fread() function
    int writefile(char []);    // Tip: Use the fwrite() function
    You may use a global structure to share among the various functions.
    When the header is printed, all values must be printed in decimal except flags and checksum. Checksum must be printed in hex and all of the flags that are set must be printed (e.g. Flags: ACK FIN)

Submit the following:

    Proof of compilation
    Source code
    Output for each of the provided binary files (test1.bin, test2.bin, and test3.bin)
    Read it in and print the headers
    Write the response to a files
    Read the response and print the headers

TCP Header Format

Source Port: 16 bits
    The source port number.
Destination Port: 16 bits
    The destination port number.
Sequence Number:
 32 bits
Acknowledgment Number: 32 bits
Data Offset: 4 bits
    The number of 32 bit words in the TCP Header.
Reserved: 6 bits
    Reserved for future use.  Must be zero.
Control Bits: 6 bits (from left to right):
    URG:  Urgent Pointer field significa
nt
    ACK:  Acknowledgment field significant
    PSH:  Push Function
    RST:  Reset the connection
    SYN:  Synchronize sequence numbers
    FIN:  No more data from sender
Window: 16 bits
    Must be zero.
Checksum: 16 bits
    Must be
ffff
.
Urgent Poin
ter: 16 bits
    Must be zero.
