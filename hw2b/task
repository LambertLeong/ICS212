Program 2b [5 pts]
Requirements:

    Write a function, halfstring, which copies the second half of a string and returns it in the second string argument.
    The function prototype must be: void halfstring(char [ ], char [ ]);
    Do not use ANY system-defined string functions (i.e. those found in the string.h library including strlen, strcat, strcpy, etc.).

Your submission must include the following:

    Source code which includes a driver in a separate file
    Makefile
    Proof of compilation using your makefile
    Three test cases

Program 2c [5 pts]
Requirements:

    Write a main function that uses at least 5 different string functions from the library (e.g strlen, strncpy, etc).
    This is a creative exercise. You can make up any combination of functions based on a user-input string.

Your submission must include the following:

    Source code which includes a driver in a separate file
    Makefile
    Proof of compilation using your makefile
    One test case with output
